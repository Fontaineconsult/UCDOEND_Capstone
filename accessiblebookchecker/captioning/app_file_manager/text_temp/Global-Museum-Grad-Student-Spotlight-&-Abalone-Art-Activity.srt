00:00:00,186 --> 00:00:00,896
>> Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,896 --> 00:00:02,606
My name is Katherine Papoulias
[assumed spelling].

3
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:06,316
I'm a second year student in the
graduate program for Museum Studies

4
00:00:06,316 --> 00:00:07,986
at San Francisco State University.

5
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:11,446
My background is in biology
and environmental policy,

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,736
and my emphasis in the program is
on education and interpretation.

7
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:19,596
The Global Museum on the San Francisco
State University campus has allowed me

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,496
to explore pretty much every
aspect of caring for museum,

9
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:27,896
from collections care behind the scenes,
to education on the public floor,

10
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,716
to museum management and fundraising.

11
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:33,906
We've learned a lot so far with this degree.

12
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:37,956
Now, I'm hoping to use all of these
skills to help change the world.

13
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:40,996
And I know that sounds really
cheesy, but just hear me out.

14
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,916
Museums are magical places.

15
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:45,836
Museums are the reason why
I studied what I studied,

16
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,826
why I care about the natural
world, why I want to protect it.

17
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:54,266
And museums feature so many different
types of things, not just animals or plants

18
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:58,626
in the Natural History Museum, but
art, and sculpture, and history.

19
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:01,416
Museums provide portals to the past.

20
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:06,256
They help us envision our future and connect
with the present all around the globe.

21
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:10,916
Now, I have been really lucky this
summer to work with the Global Museum

22
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,856
on some of their educational content.

23
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,406
We have an exhibition at the Global
Museum called Climate Stories.

24
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:21,496
It details the impacts of climate change on
indigenous communities all around the world

25
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:24,356
and features many different
objects from different cultures.

26
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:30,156
Now, what I've done the summer is develop
some lessons that take all of those stories

27
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,426
and bring them a little bit
closer to home using abalone.

28
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:36,786
Abalone are type of snail.

29
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:38,486
They've got these incredible shells,

30
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:41,906
and the Climate Stories Exhibition
features different objects

31
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:44,186
from around the world with
different types of shells.

32
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,396
But I wanted to take all of the
stories, bring them here to Bay Area,

33
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:51,176
because abalone are incredibly
important here in California.

34
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,916
They were not only important for the fishing
industry over the last hundred years or so,

35
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:01,246
but they've been used for thousands of years by
indigenous communities he's here in California,

36
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,276
including the Ohlone here in the Bay Area.

37
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:08,906
Now, what I've done is create some lesson
plans that talk about abalone as an animal,

38
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:14,026
talk about abalone as place in
California history, and some of the ways

39
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:15,876
that we can protect abalone for the future.

40
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:19,316
Keep an eye on the Global Museum
website for these lessons.

41
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:20,966
They'll be coming pretty soon.

42
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:25,276
But in the meantime, I'll show you a quick
kind of craft project you can do at home.

43
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:29,006
One of the most well-known
features of an abalone is its shell.

44
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,306
Not necessarily the outside though.

45
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:35,586
The outside of an abalone shell
might be colorful, might be faded,

46
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:39,496
might be pitted from boring sponges,
it might be covered in algae,

47
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:42,606
and it might have some hitchhikers,
like barnacles or snails,

48
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,206
but the inside of their shell is rainbow.

49
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:52,616
They have this incredible iridescent
coloration coming from a structure called nacre,

50
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,746
which we can also call Mother of Pearl.

51
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:58,136
It makes the shell super
strong and it's really pretty.

52
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:04,306
Now, we see iridescence in a lot of other
things, in some rocks, for example, feathers,

53
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:09,376
inside of mussel shells, but not everyone
has all of this iridescent material at home.

54
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:14,716
So we're going to learn a little bit more about
abalone and their iridescence by making our own.

55
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:18,846
Now, to do this craft, you will
need a shallow dish of water,

56
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:22,206
some black paper, and some clear nail polish.

57
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:27,586
First step is to take your clear nail
polish and gently touch the surface

58
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:30,646
of the brush to the surface of the water.

59
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,126
Now, you'll see it kind of spread across.

60
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:40,656
Take your black strip of paper,
gently dunk it in your water

61
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:43,696
so that the nail polish wraps around the paper.

62
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:46,856
And then what you have, it's a
little hard to see on camera here,

63
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:51,386
but you end up with these beautiful
kind of rainbow shimmering strips.

64
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:53,816
You can kind of see in the light there.

65
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:59,976
When you let it dry, you can use it as a
bookmark or anything else you can think of.

66
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,886
If you want, you can even
make your own abalone with it.

67
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:07,206
We have a craft coming to the
Global Museum website soon

68
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,556
to make your own paper mache abalone.

69
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:14,956
You can see a decorated top of mine here with a
little bit of color, it's red abalone after all,

70
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:19,946
and some barnacles made out of clay,
some fake moss to act as algae.

71
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:24,416
And then the ,inside I've covered with
some iridescent paper that I made using

72
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:26,146
that exact technique I just showed you.

73
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:32,166
If you make iridescent paper at home or a
paper mache abalone, we'd love to see it.

74
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:37,476
Stay tuned and keep an eye on the Global
Museum website for more crafts and lessons

75
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:41,146
about abalone, and tag us on social
media if you make any of these crafts.

76
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:42,256
We would really love to see them.

77
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:46,156
Thank you so much for joining,
and happy crafting.
